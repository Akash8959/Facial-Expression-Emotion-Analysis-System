# Facial Expression Emotion Analysis System

# Project Overview
The Facial Expression Emotion Analysis System is a deep learning–based application designed to detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions. The system analyzes both static images and real-time webcam video streams to identify emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, and Surprise.
It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) along with computer vision techniques to provide accurate and real-time emotion recognition through a simple web-based interface.

# Objectives
To automatically detect human emotions from facial expressions
To implement a CNN-based deep learning model for emotion classification
To support real-time emotion detection using a webcam
To provide a user-friendly web interface for interaction and visualization.

# Dataset
FER-2013

# Model Description
The emotion recognition model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It consists of multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and dense layers for emotion classification. The model is trained and evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.
